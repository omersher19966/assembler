Steps to run assembler program:
	1. Create executable file in the main by running the makefile using make program.
		object files are create in the obj folder.
	2. Run assembler executable file using command line and pass
	   the assembly files as arguments.


Prograrm running examples:
	Program running examples can be found in the example folder.
	In the success folder you can find all succsseful program runnings,
	in the failure folder all the faliure program runnings (all error messages are printed 
	to the output file) and in the screenshots you can find all screenshot related to the program 
	proper work.


Important Notes:

1.In my Assembler program there is not a number size validtation. meanning you can insert
  in several commands a number greater or less than the required size number, the program knows how to handle it.
  Basically the program will take only the required bits from the whole given number, but please notice that this
  behavior is not a recommended one because it can lead to unexcepted result. 

  for example: .db 257 will be stored as one(only the first eight bits will be stord)
------------------------------------------

2.In my Assembler program, label is a word which its ending character 
  is colon (':').
  words contain colon in the middel are not treated as label but as command. 

  for example: 
  "Next:add" is treated as a command (in this case unrecogmized command will be printed).
