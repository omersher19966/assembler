Steps to run assembler program:
	1. Create executable file in the main by running the makefile using make.
	2. Run assembler executable file using command line and pass
	   the assembly files as arguments.

Important Notes:

1. In my Assembler program, label is a word which its ending character 
is colon (':').
words contain colon in the middel are not treated as label but as command. 

for example: 
"Next:add" is treated as a command (in this case unrecogmized command will be printed).
