Important Notes:

1. In my Assembler program, label is a word which its ending character is colon (':').
words contain colon in the middel are not treated as label but as command. 

for example: 
Next:add is treated as a command (int this case unrecogmized command).

------------------------------------------

2. Parsing extermal commands is preformed before parsing entries commands. 
This can cause to an error which a label given to extern command is defined before 
the same label in entry command even if the entry command comes before the external command.

for example: 
.entry next
.extern next 

error : given label cannot be defined as entry symbol becayse it's already defined as external symbol.
